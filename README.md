**A suite of linux-rootkits** \
(why calling it "nano suit"? its a ref. from the Crysis games.)
Rootkits for Kernel  6.12.74

**Disclaimer** \
As usual, only use this on your own macine, Thank you very much!
And, this rootkit might (with 70~80% probability) crash your specific VM/bare metal because i've used dirty coding here, as the kernel updated, and also I was feverish so, this is probably bad..
..But it works. Thats what I consider a success.


**Goal of this** \
As I turned 26, I thought "lets make another rootkit for a new kernel, since fedora/qubes updated", and yeah here I am!


**If you have feedback** \
Please do open a issue with the feedback!
Any feedback, idea, or thoughts or tests is warmly welcome!


**Major Goal** \
create original ideas like for example a DISK-HIDER or SECRET-STORAGE.
