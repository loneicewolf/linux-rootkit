# linux-rootkit
A Linux File Hider Rootkit for Kernel  6.12.74


## Disclaimer ⚠️
As usual, only use this on your own macine, Thank you very much!
And, this rootkit might (with 70~80% probability) crash your specific VM/bare metal because i've used dirty coding here, as the kernel updated, and also I was feverish so, this is probably bad..
..But it works. Thats what I consider a success.


## Goal of this 
As I turned 26, I thought "lets make another rootkit for a new kernel, since fedora/qubes updated", and yeah here I am!

## If you have feedback
Please do open a issue with the feedback!
Any feedback, idea, or thoughts or tests is warmly welcome!

## Take Care!
Love from Sweden.
